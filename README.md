#Update:
After numerous requests, I have decided to start work on this source again,
The API Version Checker will announce the new update release (IF YOU REBOOT THE BOT)
In the new version the API Version Checker will check once every hour for an update,
if it finds an update on the API, it will kick the bot offline until the new update is downloaded and ran,
you will be required to delete the previous version as with the API in that source, the bot will never run.


# IMPORTANT
If you are gonna host this bot then ensure you give the original developers credit.
